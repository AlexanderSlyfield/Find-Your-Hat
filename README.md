## About

In *Find Your Hat*, you start at the top-left corner of a randomized field. Your goal is to reach the hat (`^`) while avoiding holes (`O`). The field is filled with safe spaces (`â–‘`) and your path is marked with `*`.  

This project demonstrates:

- Arrays and 2D arrays
- Randomized field generation
- Classes and static methods
- User input handling in the terminal

## How to Play

1. After running the game, you will see a grid representing the field.

Example field:
```bash
*â–‘â–‘â–‘
â–‘Oâ–‘O
â–‘â–‘^â–‘
```

   - `*` = Your current position (starting point)
   - `â–‘` = Safe field
   - `O` = Hole (falling into one ends the game)
   - `^` = Hat (find it to win)

2. Move using the keyboard:
   - `w` = Move up
   - `a` = Move left
   - `s` = Move down
   - `d` = Move right
   - `q` = Quit the game

3. Avoid holes and try to reach the hat.

4. The game ends when you find the hat, fall into a hole, go out of bounds, or quit.
